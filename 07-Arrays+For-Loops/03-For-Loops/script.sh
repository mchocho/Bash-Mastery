# The syntax of the for command is: 
#          for name [ [in [words â€¦] ] ; ] do commands; done

# Expand words and execute commands once for each
# member in the resultant list, with name bound to
# the current member.

# The return status is the exit status of the last
# command that executes. If there are no items in the
# expansion of words, no commands are executed, and
# the return status is zero. 

# An alternate form of the for command is also supported:
#          for (( expr1 ; expr2 ; expr3 )) ; do commands ; done
