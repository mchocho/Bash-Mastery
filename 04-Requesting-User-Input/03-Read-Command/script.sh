#   read [-ers] [-a aname] [-d delim] [-i text] [-n nchars]
#       [-N nchars] [-p prompt] [-t timeout] [-u fd] [name â€¦]

# One line is read from the standard input, or from the file
# descriptor fd supplied as an argument to -u. The first 
# word is assigned to the first name, the second word to 
# the second name, and so on.

# If there are more words than names, the remaining words 
# are assigned to the last name. If there are fewer words 
# read from the input stream than names, the remaining names 
# are assigned empty values. The characters in the value of 
# the IFS variable are used to split the line into words.
