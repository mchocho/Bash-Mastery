# The system's path is a variable that tells the shell
# which directories to search for executable files in.

# When you run a command in your terminal, the shell looks
# for that command in the directories defined in its PATH
# variable to see if it has a command that it can run.
# If it doesn't find an executable file with the same name
# as the command then you will get a "command not found" error.

# The benefit of adding a script to your system's path is that
# they then can be run from anywhere in your system simply
# by typing in the name of your script.

# To take a look at your system's path in your terminal just run:
    echo "$PATH"

# To add a new directory to your PATH variable you can edit the
# .profile found in the root directory. To include our ./script
# directory just include the following at the bottom of the .profile

export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/Bash-Mastery/01-Just-Like-Movie-Scripts/Adding-scripts-to-your-path/scripts"

# This will append the scripts directory to the end of the PATH
# variable. To update the profile file just reboot the terminal
# or you can run

source ~/.profile
