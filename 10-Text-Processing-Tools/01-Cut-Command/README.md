“Cut” simply means to snip a portion from a particular thing.
In Linux, the cut command is used to snip a portion from a file 
or we can say to print a particular section or a particular line.

These sections can be cut according to byte position, character position or delimiter.

The syntax of the cut command is as follows:

$ cut [option] [filename]
